Copper is an item on Serpulo and one of the most fundamental along with Lead. It is used to build the first blocks needed for an eventual massive base, those being conveyors, drills and turrets. It is mineable by all drills and mining units.
Lead is an item on Serpulo, and one of the most fundamental along with Copper. It is used to build the first electrical blocks needed for an eventual massive base, those being generators, batteries, and power nodes.
Graphite on Serpulo is made from coal via a graphite press. Itâ€™s crucial for electrical components and high-yield turret ammo. Uniquely, it can be produced from power alone, through a multi-step process starting with water extractors and spore pods.
Silicon on Serpulo, made in Smelters and Crucibles, is vital for power and unit production. It can drop to zero in multiplayer ("Siligone") due to Core schematics. Key for PvP and campaign, players may focus entire sectors on silicon production.
Coal is an item on Serpulo. Unlike Copper and Lead, it is not a building material but is instead meant to be refined into further products such as Graphite or as fuel in power generators. Unlike previous items, Coal is highly flammable and is likely to cause fires when damaged while on a Conveyor or inside a block.
Sand on Serpulo is not a building material but a key ingredient for advanced items like Silicon and Metaglass. It appears as yellow or black tiles and cannot be mined by Units unless double-tap mining is enabled. It has a hardness value of zero, similar to Scrap.
Metaglass is a manufactured resource on Serpulo, primarily used in building blocks for liquid collection, distribution, and storage, such as Mechanical Pumps and Conduits.
Titanium is a natural resource in Mindustry, mineable from the ground with a Pneumatic Drill or better. It is primarily used to build more advanced factories and conveyors, as well as some liquid-holding structures and the faster Titanium Conveyor. It is further used to make Cryofluid, Plastanium, and Surge Alloy.
Plastanium, made from Titanium and Oil, is used in advanced blocks and tier 4/5 units on Serpulo. It's also ammo for large turrets like the Cyclone, offering superior projectiles over Metaglass. Though lightly explosive, it can cause moderate explosions if stored in large quantities.
Thorium is an item on Serpulo. A natural resource, it is used for high-level structures and as a powerful fuel source in Thorium Reactors.
Phase Fabric, made from Thorium and Sand, is used in end-game blocks and projectors like the Mend and Overdrive Projectors. It's lightly radioactive and can fuel the RTG Generator, but with low efficiency and high production cost compared to Thorium.
Surge Alloy, made in a Surge Smelter, is crucial for endgame blocks, including 4x4 turrets, tier 5 units, and the Impact Reactor. It causes damaging sparks when destroyed and is used for high-damage shock ammo. Its projectiles deal extra damage to wet targets and often leech resources from the Core due to production complexity.
Scrap, mined with any drill or unit, has no direct uses but is essential for processing into other resources via Melters, Separators, or Disassemblers. It can also be turned into Sand with a Pulverizer. All Serpulo items can be obtained using scrap, water, and power, though advanced items like Surge Alloy are inefficient to produce this way.
The Spore Pod, not native to Serpulo, is used as a rudimentary fuel and can be processed into Oil and Blast Compound. Extremely flammable, it can cause fires if destroyed or if a unit holding it is killed. It provides 15% more power in Combustion or Steam Generators.
Pyratite is used as advanced fuel for Combustion, Steam, and Differential Generators and as a precursor to Blast Compound. It inflicts high damage and burning status as ammo. Its high flammability causes massive fires when blocks or units with Pyratite are destroyed, producing 40% more power in generators.
Blast Compound fuels the Impact Reactor and certain turrets, inflicting high damage with the Blasted effect. It causes massive explosions when blocks or units are destroyed. Unsafe in Combustion and Steam Generators, it deals continuous damage and only produces 40% of the base power.
Beryllium is an item available on Erekir. Along with Graphite, it is one of the two basic resources that can be mined by an Evoke or Plasma Bore (except for tiles form, which can only be mined by drills). Beryllium is the base building material for most simple logistics blocks, namely Ducts, Beam Nodes, and Reinforced Conduits.
Tungsten is a natural resource on Erekir that can appear in both floor and ore form. It is only mineable with a Large Plasma Bore, Impact Drill, Eruption Drill, and if playing on a mix-tech map an Airblast Drill. Tungsten is used in building mid-tech blocks such as advanced liquid and payload blocks, as well as the important Electrolyzer and Chemical Combustion Chamber.
Oxide is a manufactured resource exclusive to Erekir, created in an Oxidation Chamber using Beryllium and Ozone. It is used alongside Tungsten in mid-to-high level blocks such as the Pyrolysis Generator and Chemical Combustion Chamber, as well as in all heating components.
Carbide is a manufactured resource created in a Carbide Crucible by combining Graphite and Tungsten. Carbide is used in late-game blocks and can be considered one of the final resources of Erekir.
Water is an abundant liquid on Serpulo. Its primary purpose is to provide basic cooling to turrets and be used for operating the Steam Generator, as well was further refinement into Cryofluid. It is obtainable by any pump placed on water tiles, or by a Water Extractor on land. Pumps provide 50% more water on deep water tiles.
Slag, made from melting Scrap in a Melter, serves as an intermediate for processing Scrap and can be used in Wave and Tsunami turrets for melting projectiles. It causes explosions and fires when in contact with Oil and evaporates nearby Water. Slag tiles are not present in the Serpulo Campaign.
Cryofluid, made from Water and Titanium, cools turrets and reactors more effectively than Water. It is used in advanced blocks like the Impact Reactor and inflicts freezing status in Waves and Tsunamis. Unlike Water, it can't boost drills but can be used in the Exponential and Tetrative Reconstructors. Cryofluid tiles are available in custom maps but not in the campaign.
Oil, a natural liquid on Serpulo, is used to produce Plastanium and Coal. It's obtained from tar tiles, Oil Extractors, or Spore Pods. In Waves and Tsunamis, Oil causes the Tarred status effect, which deals heavy damage when combined with Burning and Melting effects. Due to its high explosiveness and flammability, Oil can cause intense fires and massive explosions when blocks or puddles catch fire, especially near Slag.
Arkycite is a liquid on Erekir. Present in pools and extractable primarily using Reinforced Pumps, it is an important liquid that powers the Chemical Combustion and Pyrolysis Generators, as well as an input for the synthesis of Cyanogen.
Neoplasm, a fluid on Erekir, is a by-product of the Neoplasia Reactor. It spreads over blocks with Water, draining liquids and causing damage until destruction. Neoplasm puddles last longer than other liquids. When a Neoplasia Reactor explodes, it creates Neoplasm puddles around it. The fluid is linked to the Latum and Renale units, with a new biological faction planned for the next update.
Ozone is a gaseous fluid available on Erekir. Along with Hydrogen, it is one of the two gases produced from the Electrolyzer and is important for running Tungsten and Oxide-level techs, especially the Chemical Combustion Chamber. It is used to boost Plasma Bores, fuel Large Plasma Bores, Eruption Drills, and Reinforced Pumps, create tier 2 units in their respective Refabricators, and is used in Regen Projectors.
Nitrogen is a gaseous fluid available on Erekir. Produced by a heated Atmospheric Concentrator, it is used in a variety of applications such as producing tier 3 units, operating Unit Cargo Loaders and boosting Large Plasma Bores.
Cyanogen is a gaseous Fluid available on Erekir. Produced by a Cyanogen Synthesizer, it is used in a variety of late-game applications such as in unit assemblers and for cooling down the Flux Reactor.
The Dagger is a Tier 1 Ground Unit on Serpulo made in the Ground Factory. It fires alternating bullets at nearby enemies and enemy blocks, much like a walking Duo. Daggers can be upgraded into Maces through the Additive Reconstructor directly, through Payload Conveyors, or by being dropped in by a carrier unit such as the Mega.
The Mace, a Tier 2 Ground Unit on Serpulo, evolves from the Dagger via the Additive Reconstructor. It unleashes bursts of flame, causing burning damage and igniting flammable structures. Maces upgrade to Fortresses using the Multiplicative Reconstructor, Payload Conveyors, or by being dropped from a Mega unit.
The Fortress, a Tier 3 Ground Unit on Serpulo, evolves from the Mace via the Multiplicative Reconstructor. It uses long-range Hail-like cannons to bombard ground targets, with projectiles damaging only the first target hit. Upgrades to the Scepter can be achieved using the Exponential Reconstructor, Payload Conveyors, or by being dropped from a Mega unit.
The Scepter, a Tier 4 Ground Unit on Serpulo, evolves from the Fortress via the Exponential Reconstructor. It features two main cannons that fire rapid shock rounds for massive single-target damage, alongside four smaller auxiliary guns for minimal additional damage. Upgrades to Reigns are available through the Tetrative Reconstructor, Payload Conveyors, or carrier units like the Quad.
The Reign is a Tier 5 Ground Unit on Serpulo obtained after upgrading the Scepter through the Tetrative Reconstructor. A gigantic version of the Dagger, it rapidly fires massive piercing bullets that shred through walls and inflict colossal amounts of damage to anything in its way.
The Nova, a Tier 1 Ground Unit on Serpulo, is made in the Ground Factory with 30 Silicon, 20 Lead, and 20 Titanium. It fires laser bolts that damage enemies and heal structures, and has a healing pulse that restores 10 health to nearby units every 4 seconds. Upgrades to Pulsars are available via the Additive Reconstructor, Payload Conveyors, or units like the Mega.
The Pulsar, a Tier 2 Ground Unit on Serpulo, evolves from the Nova via the Additive Reconstructor. It releases a conical spread of electricity that damages enemies and heals buildings, and provides a passive shield to absorb damage for allied units. Upgrades to Quasars are available through the Multiplicative Reconstructor, Payload Conveyors, or carrier units like the Mega.
The Quasar, a Tier 3 Ground Unit on Serpulo, upgrades from the Pulsar via the Multiplicative Reconstructor. It maintains Pulsar's abilities like boosting, mining Titanium and Beryllium, and healing structures. Its electric arc weapons become piercing Lancer-like lasers, and its shield regeneration transforms into a durable hexagonal barrier, akin to a Force Projector. Quasars can be upgraded to Vela through the Exponential Reconstructor, Payload Conveyors, or a payload unit like the Mega.
The Vela, a Tier 4 support Ground Unit on Serpulo, upgrades from the Quasar via the Exponential Reconstructor. It loses mining and force shield abilities but gains a powerful Meltdown-like beam that burns enemies and repairs friendly structures. It can boost and features two repair beams. The Vela can be upgraded to the Corvus through the Tetrative Reconstructor or by a payload unit like the Quad.
The Corvus, a Tier 5 support Ground Unit on Serpulo, upgrades from the Vela via the Tetrative Reconstructor. It fires a powerful, piercing laser that repairs friendly blocks and is blocked by Plastanium walls. The Corvus can't boost but has 4 insectoid legs like the Atrax, enabling it to walk over all blocks and natural walls up to 3 blocks wide.
The Crawler is a Tier 1 Ground Unit made from 8 Coal and 10 Silicon, designed to self-destruct on attack. Upgraded to Atraxes via the Additive Reconstructor, Crawlers can be countered with cheap blocks or splash damage turrets like Ripple. Player-controlled Crawlers can avoid detonation traps. In campaign mode, Arcs and cheap blocks are effective. Adding Blast Compound lets Crawlers destroy a Core: Shard in 2 blasts, but they are less effective for kamikaze tactics compared to more mobile units.
The Atrax is a Tier 2 Ground Unit evolved from a Crawler using an Additive Reconstructor. It fires burning Slag streams and can cross blocks and walls up to three tiles thick. Upgraded to Spirocts via a Multiplicative Reconstructor, Atraxes are tough to stall and cause significant fire damage. Counter them with long-range turrets like Lancer, Hail, and Ripple, and use Wave turrets to put out fires. Effective against bases with flammable materials, but less so in campaign maps with energy defenses. For increased damage, upgrade to Spirocts or use them for item delivery due to their ability to cross obstacles.
The Spiroct, a Tier 3 Ground Unit evolved from Atrax, uses health-stealing lasers that inflict Sapped status and pull in targets. Its larger chassis and six legs make it formidable, but itâ€™s best countered by quick destruction or Water projectiles from Wave and Tsunami. Scorch and Fuse turrets work well, with Scorch being cheaper and resistant to slag. Spirocts are less effective against bases compared to Zeniths and struggle with close-range turrets, but they excel defensively and against tier 4 units.
The Arkyid, a Tier 4 Ground Unit evolved from Spiroct, has a long-range electric ball attack that damages through blocks and can sap and climb walls. Upgraded to Toxopid, it gains eight 'eyes' for enhanced offense. Counter Arkyids with Tsunamis using Water and Cryofluid, high-damage turrets with Blast Compound ammo, and bullet-absorbing blocks. They excel in campaign for their self-healing and wall-climbing abilities but need careful handling to avoid Core explosions.
The Toxopid is a Tier 5 Ground Unit upgraded from Arkyid with a massive cannon for explosive electric cluster shells and powerful Fuse-like projectiles. It can cross 3-tile-wide walls and drown in deep water. Counter with high-damage units like Cyclones, long-range turrets like Foreshadows, or use air units. Use Segment blocks to absorb damage and support with Poly units for repairs.
The Flare is a Tier 1 Air Unit with high speed and alternating projectiles. Upgraded to Horizon, it excels in harassment and disrupting infrastructure. While effective for quick attacks and transport, itâ€™s vulnerable to Scatters and Metaglass ammo. Using Blast Compound or Pyratite enhances its damage, but manage its speed to avoid enemy fire.
The Horizon, a Tier 2 Air Unit, drops bombs for high area damage and targets crafting blocks. Upgraded to Zenith, itâ€™s countered by Scatters, Metaglass ammo, or Poly units. Use Pulverizers with Scatters or Parallax turrets to bait and manage Horizons. Effective for crippling infrastructure, but Zeniths eventually outclass them.
The Zenith, a Tier 3 Air Unit, fires homing missiles and upgrades to Antumbra. Counter with Scatters, Metaglass ammo, or units like Cyclones and Parallax. Effective against anti-air defenses but vulnerable to Scatters and kamikaze attacks. Despite nerfs, itâ€™s powerful for high-damage strikes and has a large item capacity.
The Antumbra, a Tier 4 Air Unit, launches bullet and missile barrages at generator blocks. Counter with high-damage turrets like Fuse, Cyclone, or Swarmer, or use Foreshadow with Surge Alloy. Itâ€™s slower than the Quad but can bypass Force Projectors, making it more effective in custom maps than in the campaign.
The Eclipse, Tier 5 Air Unit, fires piercing lasers and flak barrages, targeting Reactors while flying over walls. Defensively, use Thorium or Surge Walls, Foreshadows, and Cryofluid or Water Tsunamis. It bypasses defenses and deals high damage but needs careful management to avoid anti-air strategies.
