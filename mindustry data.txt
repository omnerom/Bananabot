Copper is an item on Serpulo and one of the most fundamental along with Lead. It is used to build the first blocks needed for an eventual massive base, those being conveyors, drills and turrets. It is mineable by all drills and mining units.
Lead is an item on Serpulo, and one of the most fundamental along with Copper. It is used to build the first electrical blocks needed for an eventual massive base, those being generators, batteries, and power nodes.
Graphite is a manufactured resource on Serpulo, created by processing coal in a graphite press or multi-press. It is used in creating electrical components and as high-yield ammo for certain turrets. Graphite is one of the few resources which can be produced from power and nothing else. This can be done by using water extractors to water cultivators, then pressing the spore pods into oil using the spore press, converting it into coal via the coal centrifuge and then finally processing it into graphite.
Silicon is an item on Serpulo, produced in Silicon Smelters and Silicon Crucibles.Many power generation and unit production blocks rely on it to get built. Due to it being a key ingredient in producing all units, Silicon can often drop to zero in multiplayer servers (a condition typically referred to as "Siligone") due to the presence of many Core-delivered unit schematics. Having solid schematics for both blocks that produce it is key to winning in PvP. In the campaign mode, some players will even dedicate entire sectors to generating mainly Silicon due to its importance.
Coal is an item on Serpulo. Unlike Copper and Lead, it is not a building material but is instead meant to be refined into further products such as Graphite or as fuel in power generators. Unlike previous items, Coal is highly flammable and is likely to cause fires when damaged while on a Conveyor or inside a block.
Sand is an item on Serpulo. It is not used to build any blocks and instead serves as another ingredient for more advanced items such as Silicon and Metaglass. It can take the form of either yellow (light) or black (dark) sand tiles, but cannot be mined by any Units unless the double-tap to mine option is enabled or if they are ordered to by logic. Sand will be mined at a drill's base rate due to its internal hardness value of zero. This trait is shared with Scrap.
Metaglass is a manufactured resource on Serpulo, primarily used in building blocks for liquid collection, distribution, and storage, such as Mechanical Pumps and Conduits.
Titanium is a natural resource in Mindustry, mineable from the ground with a Pneumatic Drill or better. It is primarily used to build more advanced factories and conveyors, as well as some liquid-holding structures and the faster Titanium Conveyor. It is further used to make Cryofluid, Plastanium, and Surge Alloy.
Plastanium is a manufactured item on Serpulo, made with Titanium and Oil. It is primarily used in more advanced blocks and in the production of tier 4 and 5 units. Large turrets like the Cyclone can use plastanium as ammo, which results in superior frag projectiles compared to using Metaglass. Although plastanium is only lightly explosive and flammable, stocking lots of them in vaults and containers may cause a moderate explosion when destroyed.
Thorium is an item on Serpulo. A natural resource, it is used for high-level structures and as a powerful fuel source in Thorium Reactors.
Phase Fabric is a manufactured resource on Serpulo made using Thorium and Sand. Its main use is in building end-game blocks such as the Tetrative Reconstructor, as well as for boosting projector blocks like the Mend Projector, Overdrive Projector and Force Projector. As it is lightly radioactive, Phase Fabric can be used as fuel for the RTG Generator. However, there is no practical reason to do so as it only produces a puny amount of 60% of the base power output and a high cost of production compared to the crude resource Thorium's 100%.
Surge Alloy is a manufactured resource on Serpulo that is created in a Surge Smelter. It is used for endgame blocks, including all 4x4 turrets (Foreshadow, Spectre, Meltdown), tier 5 units, and the Impact Reactor. It is the only item that has charge, which causes damaging sparks when blocks or units that hold it are destroyed. Surge Alloy can also be used as high-damage shock ammo in the Cyclone and Swarmer. Surge Alloy projectiles cause lightning sparks on impact, which also deal increased damage to wet targets. Due to the complex number of resources required in the Surge Smelter, Surge Alloy is often produced in set-ups that leech resources from the Core.
Scrap is an item on Serpulo. It has no uses when not processed apart from as Scatter ammo, but is primarily used to make other resources with a Melter and Separator or Disassembler. In addition, the Pulverizer can convert it into Sand. This means that every item on Serpulo can be obtained just with scrap, water and power, although obtaining advanced items like Surge Alloy will be extremely inefficient. Scrap is obtainable with any drill and any unit that can mine; it will be mined at a drill's base rate due to its internal hardness value of zero. This trait is shared with sand. Numerical, procedurally-generated sectors have a 25% chance to have scrap deposits in them.
The Spore Pod is an item on Serpulo. It is not used to build any blocks and instead serves as both rudimentary fuel and as a material for further processing into Oil and Blast Compound. Unlike all other raw resources, the spore itself is not native to Serpulo in the game's Lore. In Biomass Synthesis Facility, spores were grown for the production of fuel and plastics before an incident released them into the atmosphere, contaminating the planet and likely eliminating all other biological organisms. Spore Pods are extremely flammable and are likely to cause fires when blocks that contain it are destroyed. They will also cause fires if a unit holding it is killed. They produce 15% more power when fed into Combustion or Steam Generators.
Pyratite is an item on Serpulo. It is not used to build any blocks but instead serves as advanced fuel for the Combustion, Steam, and Differential Generators, as well as a precursor to Blast Compound and as incendiary ammo. Pyratite ammo inflicts high damage and the burning status effect. Due to its high flammability and moderate explosivity, destroyed blocks containing Pyratite will almost certainly start a massive fire that can consume entire Conveyor lines of other flammables. Units carrying Pyratite will also cause fires when they are destroyed. Pyratite in a Combustion or Steam Generator produces 40% more power. 
Blast Compound is an item on Serpulo. It is not used to build any blocks and instead serves as a fuel source for the Impact Reactor, as well as in certain turrets. Blast Compound ammo inflicts the instantaneous status effect Blasted, which deals 18 extra unreducible damage to Freezing units. Due to its high explosivity, destroyed blocks containing Blast Compounds will cause massive explosions that annihilate nearby blocks and units. Units that carry Blast Compounds will create massive explosions when destroyed as well. Blast Compound is unsafe to use in Combustion and Steam Generators and will cause continuous damage when fed in until the generator blows up. Even if it doesn't blows up due to other circumstances, it only produces 40% of the generator's base power.
Water is an abundant liquid on Serpulo. Its primary purpose is to provide basic cooling to turrets and be used for operating the Steam Generator, as well was further refinement into Cryofluid. It is obtainable by any pump placed on water tiles, or by a Water Extractor on land. Pumps provide 50% more water on deep water tiles.
Slag is a liquid on Serpulo manufactured by melting Scrap in a Melter. It is an intermediate liquid for processing Scrap into other materials, but it can also be used in the Wave and Tsunami to fire damaging melting projectiles. Puddles that form from Slag emptying from an exposed Conduit or from liquid-based turrets will cause explosions and large fires when touching Oil, as well as evaporating Water puddles nearby. It is technically extractable from Slag tiles on the map, but they are not present in the Serpulo Campaign.
Cryofluid is a manufactured liquid resource on Serpulo made from Water and Titanium. It shares many of the same uses of Water, such as cooling down turrets and reactors but is more effective and can be used for more advanced blocks like the Impact Reactor. In Waves and Tsunamis, Cryofluid projectiles inflict the freezing status effect, decreasing speed and increasing damage received. Unlike Water, it is usable in Exponential Reconstructor and Tetrative Reconstructor. However, it cannot be used to boost drills. Cryofluid can occur as Cryofluid tiles in custom maps, where any pump can be used to obtain it, albeit at half speed compared to other liquids. However, no such tiles appear in the campaign.
Oil is a natural liquid resource on Serpulo. It is used to produce Plastanium and Coal. It can be obtained by pumping from rare surface tar tiles, through an Oil Extractor, or by using the Spore Press with Spore Pods. When fed into Waves and Tsunamis, oil inflicts the Tarred status effect, which causes very heavy damage when combined with the Burning and Melting effects. Due to high explosiveness and flammability, puddles of Oil can catch on fire, especially those adjacent to puddles of Slag, and blocks holding Oil will violently explode when destroyed, dealing massive damage in the vicinity. Surface tar tiles that catch fire will burn for a long time if left unchecked.
Arkycite is a liquid on Erekir. Present in pools and extractable primarily using Reinforced Pumps, it is an important liquid that powers the Chemical Combustion and Pyrolysis Generators, as well as an input for the synthesis of Cyanogen.
Neoplasm is a fluid on Erekir produced as the by-product of an active Neoplasia Reactor. When in the environment as a puddle, it will spread to any block over them that holds Water, slowly draining their liquids and damaging them until they are fully destroyed. Any blocks under attack will spawn a puddle under them for each tile they occupy and have orange growths covering them. These puddles also last longer than those for all other liquids. When the Neoplasia Reactor overflows with Neoplasm and explodes, puddles of the fluid will also be formed around the block. Neoplasm is linked to two hidden, creature-like units that can interact with this fluid, those being the Latum and Renale. It is planned for a new faction containing these units to be added in the next update, with a diverse set of biological organisms acting as both units and blocks. However, unlike Renale, Latum will probably cease to exist.
Ozone is a gaseous fluid available on Erekir. Along with Hydrogen, it is one of the two gases produced from the Electrolyzer and is important for running Tungsten and Oxide-level techs, especially the Chemical Combustion Chamber.
It is used to boost Plasma Bores, fuel Large Plasma Bores, Eruption Drills, and Reinforced Pumps, create tier 2 units in their respective Refabricators, and is used in Regen Projectors.
Nitrogen is a gaseous fluid available on Erekir. Produced by a heated Atmospheric Concentrator, it is used in a variety of applications such as producing tier 3 units, operating Unit Cargo Loaders and boosting Large Plasma Bores.
Cyanogen is a gaseous Fluid available on Erekir. Produced by a Cyanogen Synthesizer, it is used in a variety of late-game applications such as in unit assemblers and for cooling down the Flux Reactor.
The Dagger is a Tier 1 Ground Unit on Serpulo made in the Ground Factory. It fires alternating bullets at nearby enemies and enemy blocks, much like a walking Duo. Daggers can be upgraded into Maces through the Additive Reconstructor directly, through Payload Conveyors, or by being dropped in by a carrier unit such as the Mega.
The Mace is a Tier 2 Ground Unit on Serpulo obtained after upgrading the Dagger through the Additive Reconstructor. It spews bursts of flame at all nearby enemies, inflicting the burning status effect that damages units over time and igniting flammable infrastructure. Maces can be upgraded into Fortresses by entering the Multiplicative Reconstructor directly, through Payload Conveyors, or by being dropped from a unit with payload such as a Mega.
The Fortress is a Tier 3 Ground Unit on Serpulo obtained after upgrading the Mace through the Multiplicative Reconstructor. It uses two long-range Hail-like cannons to bombard ground enemies. The projectiles from these weapons will damage the first target they collide with, unlike the artillery weapon on the Bryde (i.e. it cannot fire over Walls). It can be upgraded into the Scepter when entering the Exponential Reconstructor directly, through Payload Conveyors, or by being dropped in through units with payload such as the Mega.
